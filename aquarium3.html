      <h1>How to maintain your Aquarium</h1>
      <p>The easiest way to maintain your aquarium is to just do a 10 percent water change every week. Water changes are easy to do and don't take lots of time. It is by far the easiest way to keep algae under control and keep your aquarium clean. Some equipment you might need are <br>A bucket<br>python water change system<br></p>
      <h1> Testing Aquarium Water</h1>
      <p>Water chemistry is not visible; therefore, it is vital to check it on a regular basis. The best way to make this a routine is to check on the tank chemistry while changing the water.<br>The vital parameters are pH, nitrates, nitrites, and carbonate hardness (salinity for marine tanks).<br>Stability is the main factor with pH. pH in the range of 6.5 – 7.5 is suitable for most species, but they can adjust if slightly out of range.<br>KH (carbonate hardness) is the indicator of pH stability. It should be kept under close observation if it comes close to 4.5 dH (degree hardness) or 80 ppm. You must take action if it decreases any further.<br>Half a teaspoon of baking soda per twenty-five gallons of water will raise the kH by about 1 dH (17.8 ppm).<br>Nitrites should be undetectable at all times (except during cycling). If you detect nitrites make sure you check on ammonia as well.<br>Nitrates should be kept below 10 ppm in freshwater and 5 ppm in marine and reef (preferably 0 ppm).</p>
      <h1>Aquarium Filtration</h1>
      The proper function of the filter is essential. Filter inserts (floss, Algone, activated carbon) should be changed at least every four weeks. A high fish load may require shorter periods. Trapped particles will decompose in the filter as they would in the tank. The filter should also be cleaned once a month (do not touch the bio-wheels, if present) by using the water extracted from the tank during the water change.
      <h1>Recommended Aquarium Maintenance Routine</h1>
      <h1>Daily</h1>
      <p>Make sure the equipment is running properly.<br>Watch your fish during feeding. Behavioral changes are a good indicator of a potential problem.</p>
      <h1>Weekly</h1>
      <p>Count your fish. In case of fish death, smaller species can decompose quickly, resulting in ammonia and nitrite spikes, and eventually high nitrate levels.</p>
      <h1>Every Other Week</h1>
      <p>Test your water for the vital parameters: pH, carbonate hardness, nitrite and nitrate.<br>Change 10-15% of the water..<br> Vacuum the gravel .<br>Clean the aquarium walls. Filter floss is fairly cheap and very efficient. Start from the bottom upward and rinse out often.<br>Rinse filter inserts (cartridges) with the extracted water.</p>
      <h1>Monthly</h1>
      <p>Replace filter inserts, cartridges, floss, carbon, and Algone.<br>Inspect tubing, connections, airstones, skimmers and other parts for proper operation.<br>Clean aquarium top to assure your lighting is not affected.<br>Check the expiration dates printed on the boxes and bottles of the aquarium supplies you use. Do not use after the imprinted date. Expired test kits will give false readings and may prompt you to take unnecessary action.</p>
